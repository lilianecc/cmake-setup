<h1>Code for Setup Cmake</h1>
Here is an example on how to setup a folder called multiply and a gtest folder with it's own CMakeLists.txt <br>
Overall it will be run by a CMakeLists.txt outside in the CMAKE-SETUP folder<br>


**To run this in Command line** <br>
`cmake -S . -B build/` <br>
`cmake --build build/` <br>

**To run this in VSCode**
There is 3 vscode tests currently
1. Debugging the multiply folder
2. Google test on addition
3. Google test on multiply
