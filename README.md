Here is an example on how to setup a folder called multiply and a gtest folder with it's own CMakeLists.txt
Overall it will be run by a CMakeLists.txt outside in the CMAKE-SETUP folder

**To run this in Command line**
`cmake -S . -B build/`
`cmake --build build/`

**To run this in VSCode**
There is 3 vscode tests currently
1. debugging the multiply folder
2. google test on addition
